I am funded by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I am a co-founder and co-leader of the Diversity & Inclusion in Biological Sciences (DIBS) group for members of the Department of Biology. For more information, see the [DIBS](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bio/sites/wibs/) website.

I completed my B.A. in 2017 in the [Renn lab](https://www.reed.edu/biology/renn/) at [Reed College](https://www.reed.edu/).
