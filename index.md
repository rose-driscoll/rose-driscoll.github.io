I am a PhD student in the [Brisson lab](https://www.brissonlab.org/) at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) in the [Department of Biology](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/bio/). My [research](/research/) focuses on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in pea aphids.

I am funded by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) as well as the [Donald M. and Janet C. Barnard Fellowship](https://www.rochester.edu/college/gradstudies/prospective/fellowships.html#bernard) administered by the University of Rochester.

I completed my B.A. in 2017 in the [Renn lab](https://www.reed.edu/biology/renn/) at Reed College.
