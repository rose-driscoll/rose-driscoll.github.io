## NSF GRFP

I applied for the GRFP during the 2017, 2018, and 2020 competitions, and was honorable mention'd in 2017 and awarded in 2020. I've put together a document of [advice](/pdf/GRFP_advice_Driscoll.pdf) for other students applying for the GRFP, based on my experience, and am also happy for people to look at my successful statements ([personal statement](/pdf/Driscoll_personal_statement.pdf) and [research proposal](/pdf/Driscoll_research_proposal.pdf)) and [reviews](/pdf/Driscoll_GRFP_reviews_2020.do) (opens in Adobe Reader) from 2020 for inspiration. Best of luck to anyone applying!
