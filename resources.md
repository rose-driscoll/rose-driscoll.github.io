## R/tidyverse

I'm really passionate about [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and specifically about the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) family of R packages, and have built a series of workshops that I use to teach some tidyverse basics. I've run these workshops in a class-style format a couple of times, but the materials (two Rmd files, supplied in a zip file below) should also be quite intelligible to just read and work through.

These workshops are geared towards people who have some facility with R, but little to no experience with the tidyverse. They are organized as a two-workshop series, with the first part covering various data manipulation tools and the second focusing exclusively on ggplot2. Each part takes approximately 2-3 hours to work through.

## NSF GRFP

I applied for the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) during the 2017, 2018, and 2020 competitions, and was honorable mention'd in 2017 and awarded in 2020. I've put together a document of [advice](/pdf/GRFP_advice_Driscoll.pdf) for other students applying for the GRFP, based on my experience, and am also happy for people to look at my successful statements ([personal statement](/pdf/Driscoll_personal_statement.pdf) and [research proposal](/pdf/Driscoll_research_proposal.pdf)) and my [reviews](/pdf/Driscoll_GRFP_reviews_2020.do) (opens in Adobe Reader) from 2020 for inspiration. Best of luck to anyone applying!
