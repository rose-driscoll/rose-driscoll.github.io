## Phenotypic plasticity in pea aphids

Pea aphids exhibit a dramatic wing polyphenism which is environmentally regulated in females. I use pea aphids in my research in order to understand how plasticity and polyphenisms may evolve and be regulated over time.

## Where do genes involved in regulating wing plasticity come from?

Using transcriptomics, we can determine what genes are upregulated or downregulated in aphids exposed to different environmental conditions (see our recent [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.14174)). I ask whether these plasticity-related genes are vertically inherited from insect ancestors, or whether some may be derived from horizontal gene transfer events.

## What is the genetic basis of variation in plasticity between pea aphid lines and biotypes?

The pea aphid species is subdivided into a number of biotypes which have diverged and specialized to live on different host plants over the past tens to hundreds of thousands of years. [We observed](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.14174) that some biotypes have strong plasticity, while other biotypes seem to have nearly or completely lost the plasticity, and with it the ability to produce the winged phenotype. I am conducting a QTL mapping study to understand what genetic changes may have occurred to produce this plasticity loss.

## How can plasticity be transgenerationally regulated?

The pea aphid wing plasticity is transgenerational, with a mother aphid's environment determining the phenotype of her offspring. However, only wingless mothers appear to be capable of this plasticity; winged mothers consistently produce only wingless offspring in all environments. I seek to understand the relationship between phenotype and capacity for plasticity, as well as to determine whether this effect persists past a single generation (i.e., to granddaughters, great-granddaughters, etc. of winged aphids).
